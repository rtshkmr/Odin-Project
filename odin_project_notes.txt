BASIC SETUP:

========================================

- syncing github:
    - install binaries on local machine
    - generate ssh key, pwd protected and stored on local host
    - sync via browser to github account


- testing first rails app
    - error: can't create on a mounted drive that syncs w rsync, so 
             use a local dir instead. Everything works well
    - pushing commit to github

- setting up Heroku account:
    - after installing, 
    - add public keys on local host to Heroku
    - create a Heroku app
        = prep rails for Heroku Deployment = 

    - migrate to Heroku
    - start and play around w template webapp :)






LEARNING ABOUT GIT:

========================================


git learning resources: 
    - cheat sheet: https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4 CLI basics
    - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/
    - https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/basics/basic-workflow#start


- remember to pull first before pushing code when you want to make a commit


- common worflow: 
    1) create a branch, name it appropriately.
    2) checkout and work on it
    3) push from local to remote repository


    merging:
    - checkout master and then pull it in case any new changes made onto master
    - then check merged branches
    - then merge the ready branch
    - then push the changes onto the (remote) master
    - delete that local branch and check all branches
    

- gitignore templates [todo]
    https://github.com/github/gitignore





NB: there are two repos: 
    - local repository: in the .git folder of the root dir of your project 
    - remote repository: on the remote server on internet/local network
Origin is the placeholder name for the URL of the remote repository. Can use Originto access 
the remote repository without having to enter a full URL each time. Hence, we canhave multiple remotes
for a repository by giving each a unique name






FRONT END BASICS:

========================================
- how the web page is STRUCTURED (HTML), how it LOOKS (CSS), and how it
  FUNCTIONS (JavaScript). 
- your browser handles figuring out how to make these files into a functioning
  web page (not the server).
