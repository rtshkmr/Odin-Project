# Odin-Project

My attempt at learning webdev, primarily to complete the CVWO assignment. 
Chose to do this first instead of directly doing the assignment because I felt it gives
a pretty good foundation for the concepts that will be useful later. 


See [Odin Project to understand the curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/tracks/)

Currently following the **Full-Stack on Ruby Rails** Track.
