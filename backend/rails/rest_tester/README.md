# Learning Points from this tutorial

1. Using the RestClient, creating a script subdir under app for scripts and then running the test from `app/script/rest_requestor.rb` to test HTTP requests for the various routes

2. Rails only allows POSTS to be done in the form of **forms**, cli post request e.g. using the RestClient, will give `ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken (ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken):` error
